# Enderwire
This repository outlines the steps to convert your Ender 3 into a CoreXZ movement printer based on the Voron Switchwire.

**Disclaimer**: Proceed with caution, many steps in a conversion could lead to injury especially when dealing with mains wiring. Do so at your own risk, I take no responsibility or liability for your own actions, this guide is informational only.

# Prerequisites:
* Your printer is an Ender 3 with either a 2040 or a 4040 Y-axis extrusion.
* Your printer has a 32-bit mainboard (Creality 4.2.2 or 4.2.7) if you plan to reuse the Creality mainboard.
* You have access to a printer that can print ABS parts (the stock Ender 3 with the white PTFE tube and non-all metal hotend is not recommended or even really safe to print ABS with)
* You are familiar or comfortable enough building a 3D printer from scratch, and are able to figure out how to source your own parts and read documentation.

# Parts:

### Models and Repositories for the Ender Printable Conversion Parts:
*For Enders with a 4040 y-extrusion:*
DarkDog's Rev.2 Conversion: https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW/tree/Rev.2

*For Enders with a 2020 y-extrusion:*
Gizzle's Non-Pro Conversion: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Gizzle/ender-3_(pro)_switchwire
Thomasjfen's Non-Pro Conversion: https://github.com/thomasfjen/enderwire_nonpro

If you have a non-pro Ender 3 (aka: the 2040 y-extrusion version) it's recommended to print the majority of DarkDog's parts, and use the y-axis parts from Gizzle or Thomasjfens repositories. (You'll have to mix and match and figure out what will work since the non-pro is not really a mainstream conversion)

### Stealthburner Repository:
The Enderwire conversion you can really use whatever hotend and toolhead you can find parts for (again, you'll have to do the legwork to find models and info about these not-commonly-used setups) -- however for the easiest time it's recommended to use the Stealthburner toolhead.

The repository for the Stealthburner toolhead can be found here: https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/tree/main/STLs
